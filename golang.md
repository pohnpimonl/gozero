# Golang 101

## History of golang

    Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases.
    The designers wanted to address criticisms of other languages in use at Google, but keep their useful characteristics

## Why golang

    The goals of the Go project were to eliminate the slowness and clumsiness of software development at Google, and thereby to make the process more productive and scalable. The language was designed by and for people who write—and read and debug and maintain—large software systems.

    Go's purpose is therefore not to do research into programming language design; it is to improve the working environment for its designers and their coworkers. Go is more about software engineering than programming language research. Or to rephrase, it is about language design in the service of software engineering.

## Why golang ( IMHO )

    - easy to learn ( but hard to master )
    - C - Style
    - Good for backend service
    - Concurrency ( easy to write. but concurrency it still hard topic for me)
    - Fast enough ( if you don't want GC use rust instead.)
    - No OOP ( but still have some ability of OOP )
    - NO FP ( before but not sure in the future)
    - TTD ( Table test development )
    - go tool
    - error handler ( new thing to me when i learn but i think easy to handle error thing)
    - Boring thing, I mean software engineer should be boring thing. ( when deploy, when release, when upgrade version and more)

## Go for java developer

    No classes
    No constructors
    No inheritance
    No final
    No exceptions
    No annotations
    No try catch
